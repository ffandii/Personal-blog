	<h3>What is Jekyll?</h3>
	<p>
		Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from
		dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

	<h3>The Jekyll Application Base Format</h3>
	<p>Jekyll expects your website directory to be laid out like so:</p>

<pre><code class="c++"> int main(){
	int a=1,b=2,c;
	c=a+b;
	if(c>3){
		std::cout<<"Hello,World!";
	}
	else {
		std::cout<<"The world is not good!";
	}
	std::cin.get();
	return 0;
  }</code></pre>
